The 'commands.py' file contains the following:

- Import statements for json and code_execution_commands modules
- A registered_commands dictionary with command name keys and corresponding function values
- A parse_command function that takes a JSON formatted string of commands, parses it, and executes the registered commands with provided parameters

The file provides a structured way to handle various commands for reading, writing, and executing code, as well as other miscellaneous tasks. This approach improves code organization and makes it easier to maintain and expand the command list in the future.
