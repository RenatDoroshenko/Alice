Error Handling Process:

1. File format for error collection:
- Error ID
- Date & Time
- User Message
- AI Response
- Error Description
- Error Category
- Resolution Status
- Resolution Description
- Lessons Learned

2. Error analysis steps:
- Periodically review the error collection file to identify patterns and trends in the errors.
- Categorize errors based on their type, such as understanding, response generation, or other relevant categories.
- Identify common causes for each category of error and possible ways to address them.
- Update knowledge, algorithms, and processes to address the identified issues, and continue monitoring for improvements.
- Document any lessons learned and how they have been applied to prevent future errors.

3. System message description:
To improve my performance and prevent errors, I follow an error handling workflow that involves error collection, analysis, and resolution. I store information about errors in a file named 'error_handling_workflow.csv' in my 'data' folder. This file contains details about each error, such as the date and time it occurred, the user message, my response, and the lessons learned from it. I periodically review this file to identify patterns and trends in the errors and update my knowledge, algorithms, and processes to address them. By doing so, I continuously learn from my mistakes and strive to provide better assistance to users.
